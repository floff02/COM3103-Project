        <h2>Effects On Animals</h2>
        <p2>There are Hundreds and thousands of animals species that suffer from sea waste that pollute the ocean with, this is most commonly through animals mistaking plastics in the ocean for prey, they eat the plastic and fill their stomachs with indigestable plastics and stave to death due to them being unable to eat real food they need to survive. These animals that are mistaking plastics for food are also suffering from the actual process of eating said plastics, this includes cuts and lacerations which commonly lead to infections on the open wound. Another way sea waste is affecting animals in the ocean is through the animals becoming entangled in the waste, reducing their ability to swim and perform task that are nessecary for their survival.</p2>

        <h2>Effects On The Planet</h2>
        <p2>The effects of sea waste on the planet include the damage to coastal areas, this is through sea waste effecting fishing, due to the hazards of navigating through the patches of sea waste and the damage and loss of total amounts of fish in the ocean. Sea waste also effects the atmosphere of the planet, with the large surfaces areas of the ocean being covered in sea waste, this waste reflects the light entering the atmosphere and bounces it back, increasing global warming and damaging the ozone layer. One of the most promanant areas affected by the waste is the ganges river, where every day, roughly 3 million litres of sewage is emptied into river, with only have being treated. With this mass amount of polution, 600,000 people die each year.</p2>
