        <p1>A great way to help sea waste passivly is the reduce, reuse, recycle modle. Doing this you can massivly lower your carbon footprint, save money, and have an impact of the sea waste catastrophe that is currently happening. This can be done threw simple things such as buying your own none plastic shopping bags, using reuseable metal straws instead of plastic straws, having your own water bottle, reusing takeaway containers instead of throwing them away, buying reusable coffee cups. Instead of throw old clothes away, donate them to charities, selling old technology online instead of putting it in land fill.
